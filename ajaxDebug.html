            I monitored Twitter with the Firebug tool and I noticed that there aren't a ton of rquests when I am just sitting in the page, 
            but when I start scrolling in the feed there are a lot more of both GET and POST requests. I would assume that this is because 
            as I scroll the feed, the site has to load more content continuously. All of the requests were marked with 200 status, so they
            are all from the server instead of the cache. I also noticed that many of the requests were from pbs.twimg.com, which I assume
            is where they store the images and video files, but every once in a while there will be a JSON request from the twitter api.
